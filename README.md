# questions_project_in_py
This program implements a simple fill-in the blank questionnaire in a command-line interface. The program has 3 difficulty settings, easy/medium/hard. Once the users selects their desired difficulty level, they are given a series of 4 - 5 questions. These questions are loaded from a CSV file (provided).
